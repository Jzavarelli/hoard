Prelude
<br />
The below git code is to do a fresh install of the repository and how to do continuous pushes that involve proper `full-messaged` commits.

> Git Fresh Install
```
git lfs install
git clone <repo:http>
```

> Git Status Commit Structure
```
git status
git add --all
git commit -m "<full-body message>"
git push origin main
```

<br />
Repository Purpose
<br />
The following developments are for personal use and exist under the intellectual ownership of Jace Zavarelli and ZA Entertainment LLC. The developments are focused on multiple languages that help to highlight the programming abilities of the developer. The developments implement databases, JSON, UML, design processes, object-oriented structures, theoretical optimizations, and much more computer science developments.

## Game Archiver Software
### Language: Java 17+
<br />
Git Bash
<br />
When using git repositories there may be a need for git to be installed to the computer. To install git navigate to the below website and install the git bash software, which will ask for many specific items to be installed. During the install, you will want to select all the recommended and default install pathways, but do not need to install any additional software that is offered. 
<br />

Game Archiver Installation
<br />
Before installing, create a folder called **Repository** that will hold the repository that you install, once in the new folder _Right-Click_ within the folder and select the option to _Open in Terminal_. You will want to run an installation of **LFS** for git and will then clone the repository, which is done after Git Bash is installed on the system.

```
git lfs install
git clone https://github.com/Jzavarelli/hoard.git
```


The above code will install LFS, a git tool that allows for large files to be easily transfered across the github platform. Then the clone will grab the most recent build of the current repository, which will allow you access to the following game archiver. The next step is then to create a shortcut of the **Game Archiver** jar file that is within the _hoard_ repository.
<br />
**Do Not Move Any Items From The Repository** if you desire for the software to work, the early builds of the different programs in the repo depend on the file heirarchy. Once the shortcut is brought to the users desktop they can access and use the software easily.
